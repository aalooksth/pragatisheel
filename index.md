## History
As per the inscription of Setupati (resting house) in 1862 BS, the resting house was made by Setupaddhye Acharya to accomodate travellers and feed Brahmins. He had also donated 40 muri land to the resting house. The resting house also served a language school for educating Vedas. Later all the property was transferred to the school.
